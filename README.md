# Flappy Bird

Flappy Bird is a classic game where players control a bird to fly through a series of obstacles, aiming to achieve the highest score possible. This project replicates the iconic gameplay using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Gameplay üïπÔ∏è
- **Controls**: Press any key or click the mouse to flap the bird's wings and navigate it through the obstacles.
- **Obstacles**: The game features green pipes positioned at different heights on the screen. The player must guide the bird through the gaps between the pipes to avoid collisions.
- **Scoring**: Each successful passage through a pair of pipes earns the player one point. The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or if it falls to the ground.

## Tech Stack üíª
### Frontend:
- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the game, including elements like the canvas for rendering graphics and the scoreboard.
- **CSS**: Styles the game elements, defining their appearance and layout on the screen.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the game logic, including bird movement, pipe generation, collision detection, and score tracking.

## Game Logic üß†
The game's JavaScript code is structured as follows:
1. **Initialization**: Set up the game canvas, load assets (such as bird image and pipe sprites), and initialize variables for bird position, velocity, and score.
2. **Main Loop**: Continuously update the game state and render the graphics.
3. **User Input**: Listen for user input (keypress or mouse click) to control the bird's movement.
4. **Bird Movement**: Update the bird's position based on gravity and user input, simulating flight physics.
5. **Pipe Generation**: Generate pipes at random intervals and positions on the screen.
6. **Collision Detection**: Check for collisions between the bird and pipes, ending the game if a collision occurs.
7. **Score Tracking**: Increment the score when the bird successfully passes through a pair of pipes.
8. **Game Over**: Display the game over screen and allow the player to restart the game.
